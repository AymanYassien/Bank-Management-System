# Bank Management System (BMS)
- I developed a Console Application Project using C++ Programming Language based on file-based system, simulation for Bank System, 
managing users and clients, doing Transactions, and a section for Currencies exchanging. 

- This became to apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this project was in a 
functional paradigm converted to the OOP paradigm.

- C++ is not the best Language to apply OOP principles, but it is nice and challenging, I hope I can 
convert it into a big project with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Relational Database System 
(RDBS).

## How to Install and Run the Project?
[1] Clone code to your machine `(Prefered on Unix OS )`. 
[2] Run code on `C++` Compiler. 
[3] Login with UserName: `User1` & Password `1234`. 
[4] Login with UserName: `User5` & Password `5555`. 
[5] Notice differences between `User1` and `User5`.
